# Streamlit Purchase Prediction App

## Overview

This project is a **Streamlit application** designed to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on key features such as **gender**, **age**, and **estimated salary**. The application leverages a pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to generate predictions, providing a user-friendly interface for input and immediate results.

## Requirements

The application relies on several Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Below is a brief description of the key libraries included:

- **Streamlit**: The core library for building web apps, allowing for real-time interaction and visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Utilized for machine learning functionalities, specifically for the SVM model.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Essential for data handling and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Flask**: A minimal web framework to build and deploy the application, especially if backend APIs are involved.
- **TensorFlow**: For handling advanced machine learning tasks if needed in the future.
- **Requests**: To make HTTP requests, if integrating external APIs.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping, if relevant datasets are fetched from the web.

## Installation

To set up the environment and dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
